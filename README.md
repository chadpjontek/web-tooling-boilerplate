# web-tooling-boilerplate

### _A boilerplate for starting an app using webpack4 and various loaders to help automate development tasks, linting, transpiling, testing, bundling, image compressing and minifying._

The purpose of this boilerplate is for myself and others to quickly start a project with most of the common tools needed for development. This is, of course, subjective but I find myself needing these tools often. All are welcome to fork this and change to their own liking. I've tried to include comments in these files describing each of their purposes but you may need to look at the documentation for a better understanding.
